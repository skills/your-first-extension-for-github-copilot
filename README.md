## Welcome

People love how GitHub Copilot helps them write code faster and with fewer errors.
But what if it already knew some context about your job, your team, or company?
In this exercise, we will make a custome extension for GitHub Copilot that can help you with that.

- **Who is this for**: Intermediate developers familiar with GitHub Copilot, basic GitHub, and basic web development
- **What you'll learn**: We'll introduce GitHub Copilot Extensions and how to customize them.
- **What you'll build**: You'll load an existing template extension and then modify it to support a high school's staff.
- **Prerequisites**: Skills Exercise: Getting Started with Copilot
- **How long**: This course takes less than one hour to complete.

In this course, you will:

1. Start up a preconfigured coding environment for making GitHub Copilot Extensions.
2. Run the template extension
3. Connect the extension to your GitHub account
4. Customize the extension to your needs

### How to start this exercise

1. Right-click **Copy Exercise** and open the link in a new tab.

   <a id="copy-course" href="https://github.com/new?template_owner=skills&template_name=your-first-extension-for-github-copilot&owner=%40me&name=skills-your-first-extension-for-github-copilot&description=My+Course:+My+Copilot+Extension&visibility=public">
      <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/ðŸ“ _Copy_Course-008000" height="25pt"/>
   </a>

2. In the new tab, most of the prompts will automatically fill in for you.

   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
   - Scroll down and click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.

3. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds for the course to be prepared.

   - The **Copy Course** button will deactivate, changing to gray.
   - The **Start Lesson** button will activate, changing to green.

4. Click **Start Lesson**. Follow the step-by-step instructions and feedback will be provided as you progress.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Start Lesson** button will activate after copying the course. You will probably need to refresh the page.
